# Data Sources

## Adding a data source

There are three ways to add a data source:

### 1. Using the UI

After creating an app, youâ€™ll land on the "**Getting Started**" page, where you can connect your database. Select the database you want to connect and enter the connection details. Once connected, the data source will be added to your app.

### 2. Using the CLI

On the same "**Getting Started**" page, you can choose "**Edit file manually**" option to add a data source using the CLI. 

### 3. Manually

You can also add a data source by creating a new directory in the `server/data-sources` folder and add a `index.js` file inside it. The file should export a function that returns a data source object.

After this, go to `./app/.server/data-sources/registry.js` and add the data source to the registry.

Restart the server to apply the changes.

## Table configuration

Each data source configuration contains a `tablesConfig` object that allows to define restrictions and permissions for each table globally.

The following table configuration options are available:
- **`excluded`**: Excludes the table from any requests. By default, all tables are included.
- **`excludedColumns`**: Excludes the specified columns from any requests. By default, all columns are included.
- **`preventInsert`**: Prevents the insert operation. By default, insert operations are allowed.
- **`preventUpdate`**: Prevents the update operation. By default, update operations are allowed.
- **`preventDelete`**: Prevents the delete operation. By default, delete operations are allowed.

```typescript title="Example"
const dataSource = createDataSource({
  type: DataSourceType.postgres,
  name: 'postgres',
  init: () => {/* ... */},
  tablesConfig: {
    // Configuration for the 'payment_methods' table
    payment_methods: {
      // Excludes the `payment_methods` table from any requests.
      excluded: true,
    },

    // Configuration for the 'users' table
    users: {
      // Excludes the 'password' column from any requests.
      excludedColumns: ['password'],

      // Prevents insertions into the 'users' table.
      preventInsert: true, 

      // Prevents updates to the 'users' table.
      preventUpdate: true,

      // Prevents deletions from the 'users' table.
      preventDelete: true,
    },
  }
});
```

By default, if table configuration is not provided, the table is included in all requests.
