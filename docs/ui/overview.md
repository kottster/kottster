# UI Library

Kottster includes a built-in package, `@kottster/react`, which provides essential UI components and React hooks for building your app’s frontend.

## What’s included

- [**Components**](./table-page-component.md) — Pre-built elements like buttons, forms, tables, inputs, and more.
- [**Hooks**](./use-page-hook.md) — Useful React hooks for working with UI state, side effects, and interactions.

## Mantine

Kottster’s UI is built on top of [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/), a modern React component library. You can use Mantine components directly in your pages—they work out of the box and integrate well with the Kottster UI.

## Tailwind CSS

You can also use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first styling. It works well alongside Mantine.  
To set it up, follow the [official guide for Vite](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) or [PostCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss), depending on your setup.
