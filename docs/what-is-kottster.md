## Use cases

- **Admin Panels**

  Connect your database and get instant admin pages. Kottster automatically creates table views with edit, create, and delete functions. It even detects relationships between tables and makes it easy to work with connected data. You can also build fully custom pages with your own logic and UI.

- **Dashboards**

  Create dashboards to monitor and visualize your data. Use charts, statistics, and custom components to get insights at a glance.

- **Internal Tools**

  Build custom tools for your team. Use the visual builder to create exactly what you need, or start with ready-made templates. Perfect for content management, user admin, or any data entry tasks.

## Developer experience

Kottster makes building admin panels simple and fast.

- **Quick Setup:** Run one CLI command to create your app. Connect your database and start [generating admin pages](https://kottster.app/generate-admin-panel) right away.

- **Visual Editor:** Build pages without writing code using our visual builder. Or write custom code when you need more control.

- **Smart Database Integration:** Kottster scans your database and automatically handles relationships. Foreign keys become easy-to-use dropdowns. Related records show up where they should.

- **Full Customization:** Need something special? Build completely custom pages with React and JavaScript. Mix generated and custom pages in the same app.

## Self-hosted & Secure

Your data stays with you.

- **Self-Hosted by Design**

  Your database credentials and data [never leave your app](./security/database-access.md). Kottster runs entirely on your servers, giving you complete control over security, compliance, and data access. No third-party platform ever touches your sensitive information.

- **Deploy Anywhere**

  [Deploy to any platform](./deploying.md) that runs Node.js. Use cloud services, VPS, or on-premises servers. You control where your app runs.

- **Built-in Auth**

  User login and management [comes included](./app-configuration/identity-provider.md). No need to build your own authentication system.

## Easy to start, flexible to grow

- **Minimal Requirements**

  Just [create the project](./index.md), [connect your database](./data-sources.md), and [deploy](./deploying.md). The generated pages work immediately for basic data management.

- **Grow as You Need**

  Start simple with auto-generated pages. Add custom features as your requirements grow. Basic JavaScript knowledge is enough for most customizations.

- **Modern Stack**
