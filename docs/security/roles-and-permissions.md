# Roles and Permissions

Kottster uses a role-based access control system where users are assigned roles, and these roles can have specific permissions. This allows you to control what parts of your app users can access and what actions they can perform.

## How it works

The system is built around two key concepts:

- **Roles** - Groups that users can be assigned to (e.g., Admin, Project Manager, Support)
- **Permissions** - Specific actions or access rights that can be granted to roles

Based on these roles, you can define which parts of your app users have access to. You can restrict access to specific pages and control permissions for creating, updating, and deleting records in table pages.

## Default roles

By default, each Kottster app comes with three built-in roles: **Admin**, **Developer**, and **Regular**. You can easily add your own custom roles to match your specific needs.

## Setting up page access

You can control which roles have access to specific pages using the visual editor. This can be done when creating a new page or editing an existing one. For [table pages](../table/introduction.md), you can control permissions for creating, updating, and deleting records based on user roles.
