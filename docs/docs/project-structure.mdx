# Project structure

This section explains the purpose of each file and folder in your project. Here's the breakdown:

- ## `app/`

    The main directory where your Remix app's core logic resides.

  - ### `entry.client.jsx`

        The entry point for client-side rendering. It initializes the Remix app in the browser. [Learn more](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/file-conventions/entry.client)

  - ### `root.jsx`

        The root component of your app. It defines the app’s layout, handles global styles, and manages shared logic like error boundaries. [Learn more](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/file-conventions/root)

  - ### `service-route.js`

        A special route file that handles internal API requests. **Please avoid modifying this file since it can break the app's functionality.**


  - ### `tailwind.css`

      The global CSS file for your app. It includes Tailwind directives and custom styles, if any.
  
  - ### `routes/`

      Contains all your app’s routes (pages). Each file or folder corresponds to a route or a nested route in the app. [Learn more](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/file-conventions/routes)
  
  - ### `server/`

      Contains server-side files.

      - #### `app.js`

          The file with app initialization logic. It creates a new Kottster app instance and sets up data sources.

      - #### `data-sources/`

          Contains data source files. Each folder corresponds to a data source in the app. [Learn more](/data-sources)

- ## `public/`

    The optonal directory where you store static assets like images, fonts, and other files.

- ## `app-schema.json`

    A JSON file that contains the Kottster app schema.

    Defines the app’s dependencies, scripts, and metadata. Essential for managing npm tasks and project setup.
